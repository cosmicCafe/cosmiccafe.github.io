title: Day 16 
---
I know that the phase two of the initiative was supposed to begin on day 15 but due to shipping delay the neuropharmecuticals did not arrive until yesterday evening. I'm beggining today, day 16 off as the official day that I begin phase two. That means that I will be taking 30 miligrams of Noopept and 250 milligrams of Alpha-GPC sublingualy on top of the tCDS therapy. I have resolved myself to focus on a montage of my own disovery, which I have said in previous posts, but I will henceforth reffer to as the Arcturus Montage (a little vain? yes, but no one will ever read this anyway so I don't think that it matters!).

I took a two day break last weekend, which Is why I did not post anything for three days. I found that when I started the tCDS therapy on day 15 that I demonstrated little-to-no cognitive improvment. I think that today will be different though. It seems to be that at the beginning of the weeks that the affects of the therapies aren't perceptable, but by the end of the work week (Friday), the effects are almost super-charged. Last Friday I indulged in quite a lot of drinking and use of recreational marijuana but found that the effects of these substances had extreamly diminished effect on me. I predict that the addition of the neuropharmecuticals in phase two will only increase the dampenning effects of the tCDS therapy. Fingers crossed that things work out today!
