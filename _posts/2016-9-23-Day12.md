title: Day 12 
---

It would seem that the the DARPA montage was not helping me as much as a montage that I created. The DARPA montage may have helped me learn faster, but it is the ability to utlise that information in complex ways that I am really looking for. I decided to go back to using a montage that I created myself before this experiment began. I tired my montage on day 11 and found the results to again be mind blowing. I utilized the cathode to stimulate the left prefrontal lobe while placing the anode on my right shoulder. The affects were amazing and again, the blind monitors easily took notice of my behavioural change. Today, I am switching the cathodal stimulation for anodal and seeing what happens. I am choosing to do this for a couple of reasons:  
- I want to see if anodal stimulation to this area can produce better results  
- I want to have a set routine for when I begin phase 2 of the Arcturus Initiative  
I've also already purchased two of the five neuropharmecuticals that I will be using for phase two of this initative. I would have bought them all, but that would have been around $500 and I want to see if the neuro-enhancing affects of the drugs will be worth the money first. The two enhancers that I purchased are Noopept and Alpha-GPC. I'll give more reasons for my decision to go with these two tomorrow, when I have more time to write a full report.
