My name is Echo. I'm just a nobody somewhere on the face of this pale blue dot but I dream of being so much greater. I work as a software engineer at a well respected company. I just graduated from University and am looking for ways to surpase the limits of the human mind by utilising modern science and technology. It won't be easy, it may be dangerous,  it will certainly be challanging and more than a little expensive, but I'd say the risk is worth it if the reward is even a possiblity.
